        "answer": "By dating Nammalwar to 3102 B.C. (start of Kali Yuga), the text presents the Alwars not as a later 'Bhakti Movement' reaction, but as immediate successors to the Krishna avatar, maintaining an unbroken continuity of Vaishnava devotion from the Dwapara Yuga into the Kali Yuga without a 'dark age' gap."
